data - contains all data used by code
Part1 - contains code file used for part 1 (to run it you will need to use the code directory)
Part2 - contains code file used for part 2 (to run it you will need to use the code directory)


To run part 1, navigate to the code directory and run the part1 python file
	>	py Part1.py

To run part 2, navigate to the code directory and run the part2 python file
